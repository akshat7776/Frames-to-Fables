## Week 4

### Transformers
 -[CampusX Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fX3rOjTloc&list=PLKnIA16_RmvYuZauWaPlRTC54KxSNLtNn&index=67)  
  *(Watch all videos starting from this video, i.e., video no-67 to video no-84. I understand these lectures are long and the there are many lectures but trust me guys these lectures are worth watching  and also in these lectures he tried to explain  like a school teacher  so you can watch these lectures in 1.5X or 2X)*
- Alternative Resources: 
  - [jay alammar-blog - Understanding LSTMs](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)(you must read this blog to get high level overview of the transformers.)
  - [Krish Naik's Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bPhDUSAUYI)(This is one shot 5 hours video .In this video he has explained the whole architechture of transformer with good explaination.you can refer this as campus x alternative)
  - [Attention All You Need paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)( must read paper.)
