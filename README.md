  *(Watch all videos starting from this video, i.e., video no-67 to video no-84. I understand these lectures are long and the there are many lectures but trust me guys these lectures are worth watching  and also in these lectures he tried to explain  like a school teacher  so you can watch these lectures in 1.5X or 2X)*
