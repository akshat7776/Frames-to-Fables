        "You have to try atleast 6-7 different models for image captioning, you may choose from the models available on HuggingFace or any other source. Don't stop until you find a model that gives you desired results.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may try variety of models including those based on CLIP, BLIP, Vision-Language Models, Visual Transfrmers, etc. (These are variuos multimodal architectures, you read more about their architectures, uses, etc. online). You can simply google \"image captioning models HuggingFace\" based on any architecture (CLIP, BLIP, VLM, etc.) and you will find many models that you can try.\n",
        "You may also look into their benchmark results to choose most suitable even before trying them out.\n",
        "In my opinion, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are the most suitable considering the amount of details we want in the captions, but you should try others too.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: It's ok if you don't completely understand architectures of the models you use, but you should try to understand the basic idea of how they work and if you have further doubts you can reach out to me.\n",
        "Same goes for the code that you will use to generate the captions, you can view how to use the model in the documentation of that particular model, but try to understand the meaning of all the compenents of your code.\n",
        "You may use AI tools to generate the code, but make sure to understand every part of it, else it beats the purpose.\n",

        "Also most of the image captioning models on HuggingFace will be large and computationally expensive, so you should not try to run them locally, you can use Goggle Colab, or Kaggle notebooks to run models on their servers (Kaggle provides free GPU for 30 hours per month, so I think that might be enough, even if it's not, that's why I made teams for this assignment, so that you can divide the GPU time across your team members).\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important point is that, some models will be even larger that the computational resources provided by Kaggle or Google colab, so in that case you will have to load the model in quantized format, which will reduce the size of the model and make it easier to run on limited resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantization: It is a technique used to reduce the size of a model by converting its weights from floating-point precision to lower precision, for eg. if originally the weights are in 32-bit floating point format, then you may convert them to 16 or 8 or even 4-bit format. This reduces the memory footprint of the model and makes it easier to run on limited resources. However this may also reduce the performance of the model, so you should try to find a balance between the size and performance of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "For loading a model in quantized format, there is a llibrary called `bitsandbytes`, for more details on how to use it, you can refer to online resources or ChatGPT, etc.\n",
